                <div class='padding10Top'>Pandicon is a multipurpose bot with over a hundred commands at the moment and many more to come.</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>The head developer (and also the only developer for the first half year of development) is <a class = 'text-link' href = 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5XSQeU6UcQ46zdz2plpQg' target="_blank">mkpanda</a>. There are also 2 other developers - ei2014 and aero. You can find all the developers in the <a class = 'text-link' href = 'https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW' target="_blank">support server</a>.</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>The bot development started in mid-august 2020 as a custom bot for a discord server owned by a youtuber known as <a class = 'text-link' href = 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBwRiALna3v8qUE7pqyMEw' target="_blank">Alias</a></div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>If you would like to have a feature added to the bot, you can request it in the <a class = 'text-link' href = 'https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW' target="_blank">support server</a>. You can add the bot to your server using <a class = 'text-link' href = 'https://top.gg/bot/744284134397968425/invite' target="_blank">this link</a> and you should checkout the rules for using the bot <a class = 'text-link' href = '../rules/' target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
                <div style="padding-top: 20px;"></div>
                <div style="font-size: 2rem;">Key features</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>The feature the bot started for is counting "acquirable roles" and "acquirable roles systems" - you can set any roles to be "acquirable" and then you can run &acqs to get how many acquirable roles you or the mentioned member have.</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>Pandicon also allows you to warn, mute, kick and ban people, as well as to antagonise them. When a member is antagonised, all of their roles are removed and they are given the Antagonist role, which can do anything, but the original purpose was for it to be spam pinged and the users would only be able to view one channel where they were going to be pinged, as well as they would be muted. Warned, muted and antagonist roles can be customised.</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>The bot also has an advanced levelling system, where you can customise the xp range for each channel, set up level roles, level up messages, manipulate users' xp and much more.</div>
                <div class='padding10Top'>You can also have fun with our advanced economy system that allows you to grind cookies in many possible ways.</div>
