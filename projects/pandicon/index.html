			<h2 class="center-text">Basic information</h2>
			Pandicon is a multipurpose bot with over a hundred commands at the
			moment and many more to come.<br />
			It started of as
			<a href="https://www.github.com/Pandicon">my</a> personal project
			but now ei2014 is helping me with the development of the bot. You
			can find both of us in the
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW">support server</a
			><br />
			If you would like to have a feature added to the bot, you can
			request it in the
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW">support server</a>. You
			can add the bot to your server using
			<a href="https://top.gg/bot/744284134397968425/invite">this link</a>
			and you should checkout the rules for using the bot
			<a href="#rules">here</a>.

			<h2 class="center-text">Key features</h2>
			The feature the bot started for is counting "acquirable roles" and
			"acquirable roles systems" - you can set any roles to be
			"acquirable" and then you can run &acqs to get how many acquirable
			roles you or the mentioned member have.<br />
			Pandicon also allows you to warn, mute, kick and ban people, as well
			as to antagonise them. When a member is antagonised, all of their
			roles are removed and they are given the Antagonist role, which can
			do anything, but the original purpose was for it to be spam pinged
			and the users would only be able to view one channel where they were
			going to be pinged, as well as they would be muted. Warned, muted
			and antagonist roles can be customised.<br />
			The bot has an advanced levelling system, where you can customise
			the xp range for each channel, set up level roles, level up
			messages, manipulate users' xp and much more.<br />
			You can also have fun with our advanced economy system that allows
			you to grind cookies in many possible ways.<br />

			<h2 class="center-text" id="rules">Rules</h2>
			1. Using any auto-typer, script, macro or any other way to automate
			commands is strictly forbidden.<br />
			2. Sharing exploits or game-breaking bugs with other users is
			forbidden. Report these to bot staff (you can find them in the
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW">support server</a>). In
			addition, if you come across a not harmful bug (for example the bot
			showing incorrect member count for a server), you should report it
			in the
			<a
				href="https://discord.com/channels/746082575889596456/746091314377916537"
				>bug reports channel</a
			>
			in the
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW">support server</a
			>.<br />
			3. Abusing any exploits or game-breaking bugs is also strickly
			forbidden.<br />
			4. You shouldn't require users to pay you to be able to use the bot
			or enter giveaways for the bot. The only exception to this are
			booster perks. Using level roles as a requirement is perfectly fine,
			even if you use a different bot for that.<br />
			5. Using the bot to spread racism, sexism, homophobia etc. is
			strictly forbidden.<br />
			6. You shouldn't use the economy system to advertise anything, for
			example paying people economy items if they join your server is
			forbidden.<br />
			7. Buying any bot stuff with real life currency or discord nitro is
			forbidden. Buying anything costing real money (regarding the bot)
			from unofficial sources is forbidden.<br />
			8. You shouldn't cause any unnecessary drama, start any harmful
			rumors about the bot or witch hunt bot staff.<br />
			9. Using the bot for anything harmful/illegal is strictly
			forbidden.<br />
			10. You shouldn't argue about the actions that might be taken
			against you regarding the bot by staff members. Note that you can
			always appeal, but you shouldn't prolong the process on purpose.<br />
			11. By using the bot, you accept these rules in addition to the
			<a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord Terms of Service</a> and
			<a href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a
			>.<br />

			<h2 class="center-text" id="punishments">Punishments</h2>
			Failing to follow the rules above will most likely result into
			punishments. Some of the possible outcomes are listed below.<br />
			Verbal warning: This is the lowest punishment and it will be used if
			you break a rule unintentionally and/or you breaking the rule didn't
			cause any damage.<br />
			Bot ban: This punishment allows us to adjust it depending on our
			needs. If you cause minor damage, you might get bot banned for a
			day. The automod automatically bot bans you for 12 hours if you fail
			to verify that you aren't using some sort of autotyper. The usual
			bot ban is only for 'grindable' and easily 'macroable' commands,
			such as economy ones. You might also find yourself in a total bot
			ban, which will restrict you from using any commands. This will be
			usually used if you abuse an exploit or lag the bot
			intentionally.<br />
			Data removal: If we find out that you used a macro to grind some
			economy items, we might remove them. However, if you continue to use
			some sort of automation to get items in the bot, we might as well
			remove all your data from the bot (all economy items, pats, hugs
			etc.). We can't remove per-server data, such as levels.<br />

			<h2 class="center-text" id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We collect and store data related to bot economy, server
				information, user information, and server configuration. No
				private information is stored by us, and the only user data
				stored is the user ID. All data related to the bot is owned by
				us. We reserve the right to change this data at any time, with
				or without notice. At any time, you may request any data that we
				store to be deleted. We do not collect any data related to
				message content on the servers that the bot is in, or any
				personal information visible to the bot. By giving the bot the
				permissions to do so, the bot has the ability to modify and
				change channels, roles, and users in the servers that it is in
				for setup and moderation purposes. It is necessary for the bot
				to read message content for moderation and command purposes,
				though no data related to that message content is stored or
				accessible by us, or the bot.
