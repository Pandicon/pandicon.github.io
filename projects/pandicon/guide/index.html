			<h2 class="center-text">Overview</h2>
			This is a guide explaining in-depth how everything works in the
			Pandicon economy. This will detail every economy command, mechanic,
			and feature in order to give you a better understanding of this
			system.<br />In short, the Pandicon economy system is a carefully
			crafted, detailed grinding game based off of other economy bots, as
			well as MMORPG games. Everything in the system revolves around
			“cookies”, which serve as the base currency, which you want to try
			to get, and what you use to buy most other items. You get cookies
			and other items through the economy commands, and as you progress
			through the economy, you will unlock more and more creative ways to
			gain them.

			<h2 class="center-text">Basic items</h2>
			In addition to cookies, the economy offers quite a few different
			items that you can obtain.

			<h3>Basic Ingredients</h3>
			Egg, Flour, Butter, and Sugar.<br />
			Commonly received from crates (detailed later), basic ingredients
			are used alongside the bake command in order to create a large
			amount of cookies quickly.

			<h3>Rare Ingredients</h3>
			Chocolate, Vanilla, Caramel, Cinnamon, and Blueberry.<br />
			Uncommonly obtained from commands, rare ingredients are the other
			essential component in baking cookies. Each type of cookie requires
			a different rare ingredient to make it, see the batches command for
			more detail.

			<h3>Basic Materials</h3>
			Bamboo, Metal, and Hardened Chocolate.<br />
			Ranging from very common to rare, these items form the basis of
			buying anything from the shop, and unlocking new commands.

			<h3>Advanced Materials</h3>
			Crystal, Enchanted Butter, and Shadow Egg<br />
			Ranging from very rare to extraordinarily rare, these items are less
			common materials that have pretty much the same use as the basic
			materials, albeit in smaller quantities. Consider yourself lucky if
			you get these items!

			<h3>Special Materials</h3>
			Magic Essence, Strength Concentrate, and Crown Fragment<br />
			These are niche items obtained only from the bossfight command. They
			are used alongside other materials to purchase stuff from the shop.

			<h3>Crates</h3>
			Crates are items with rarities corresponding to the basic and
			advanced materials that you can open with the open command in order
			to unlock even more items. They increase in both rarity and quality
			with each material tier, and are one of the most useful things to
			get in the economy. Vote crates can be obtained from the vote
			command, and give you more crates as opposed to more items.

			<h3>Gear</h3>
			These are items with tiers corresponding to the basic and advanced
			materials that you can buy from the shop. Gear is used in order to
			unlock and progress through the fight command by increasing the
			statistic you have called power. Power is the core mechanic that
			unlocked new economy commands, so constantly buying new gear is
			essential to progress through the system. You can see your gear and
			power using the gear command.

			<h3>Talismans</h3>
			Extremely rare items obtained from crates, these little known items
			can help to do things ranging from increasing your drop rates to
			directly increasing all profits. You can see what talismans you have
			with the talismans command.

			<h2 class="center-text">Basic grinding commands</h2>
			There is a large variety of different ways to get items, most of
			which derive from using grinding commands.

			<h3>Beg</h3>
			The most basic command, you can use beg to quickly gain small
			amounts of cookies, with a short cooldown. You can only receive
			cookies from begging, and begging is unlocked at the start of your
			journey through the economy.

			<h3>Search</h3>
			Another command that can be immediately used, searching provides
			another way to get cookies with the added benefit of being your
			first grindable way to obtain crates, which makes search a staple of
			early game progression. While it can't be used as often as beg, it
			still has a rather low cooldown.

			<h3>Bake</h3>
			Once you obtain a good amount of basic ingredients and a couple rare
			ones, you can start using this command to create a large amount of
			cookies quickly. To use this command, input the batch type you want
			to make as well as the amount of batches you want to bake, and make
			sure you have the required ingredients to make them! Use the batches
			command in order to view how many cookies come from each batch, and
			to see which ingredients are needed for them as well.

			<h3>Mine</h3>
			A very profitable command that serves as a very each way to directly
			obtain crates and materials of medium levels. Mine is unlocked by
			purchasing the “minepass” from the shop, and having at least 16
			power. It has a relatively short cooldown, but it pays off to be
			patient and not use this command too much in order to achieve
			optimal profits.

			<h3>Fight</h3>
			A very versatile command that allows for efficient grinding
			throughout the entire progression. This command allows you to engage
			in fights with enemies in order to obtain crates and other
			valuables. Your chance of success, and rewards depend on both your
			power, and your enemy's power. Basically, upon using the command,
			you will be faced with an enemy that has a power statistic similar
			to your own. If the power of the enemy is higher than your own, your
			chance of success is lower, and if your power is higher, your chance
			of success is higher. Enemies with a higher power drop better
			rewards. Upon initiating a fight, you have the option to fight or
			flee, though if you fight and fail, you have a chance to “die” and
			have this command disabled for 12 hours, so be sure to pick your
			fights wisely.

			<h3>Bossfight</h3>
			One of the most versatile grinding commands, this command allows you
			to fight various “bosses” of varying difficulties in order to obtain
			special materials. To initiate a bossfight, call the command and
			select a tier from 1 to 10 while having at least 32 power. Your
			stats in a bossfight are determined by the gear you have rather than
			your power, and the boss stats are determined by the tier you
			select. Each turn, you can either attack (deal damage to the boss),
			defend (reduce the amount of damage that can be dealt to you), or
			flee. After you pick, the boss will then take its own turn and
			either attack, defend, or do nothing. You only receive rewards for
			defeating the boss; if it defeats you then you have a chance to
			“die”, with similar consequences to fighting.

			<h3>Timely Commands</h3>
			Hourly, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.<br />
			You can use each of these commands once per time period suggested in
			the name of the command in order to receive a bamboo crate, metal
			crate, hardened chocolate crate, or crystal crate respectively. The
			monthly command is only usable by those who have donated with the
			donate command.

			<h3>Vote</h3>
			A special timely command that you can use once every twelve hours
			that allows you to vote for the bot on
			<a href="https://top.gg/bot/744284134397968425">top.gg</a> in
			exchange for a vote crate (or two on weekends!). This is the only
			way to obtain vote crates, so be sure to use it often.

			<h2 class="center-text">Info commands</h2>
			These commands show some kind of information about your economy
			profile, or something else important to the system.

			<h3>Balance</h3>
			View your current balance and net worth in cookies.

			<h3>Inventory</h3>
			Easily view every item that you have in your possession with this
			command.

			<h3>Open</h3>
			Open one or more crates of your choice.

			<h3>Batches</h3>
			Used to show the current sell price and ingredient cost of all the
			batches of cookies that you can bake.

			<h3>Shop</h3>
			Used to see the buy and sell cost of items in the economy. Check the
			shop frequently in order to figure out which item you should be
			trying to get and how close you are to being able to obtain it.

			<h3>Buy</h3>
			Buy an item from the shop. See the shop command to find out the
			names of buyable items.

			<h3>Sell</h3>
			Sell your items. See the shop command to find out the names of
			sellable items.

			<h3>Gear</h3>
			View what gear you have and don't have, and see how much power you
			currently have.

			<h3>Funds</h3>
			View the current “funding” towards the development in the bot.
			Funding is a fun thing where a tenth of all cookies grinded are
			added to a progress meter to show everyone how much the economy is
			being used. When certain milestones are reached, the developers give
			rewards to those who contributed the most, be sure to check this out
			often.

			<h2 class="center-text">
				Workstation (advanced grinding) commands
			</h2>
			These commands are unlocked by buying certain items (of very similar
			names) from the shop, and can be used to further enhance the more
			late game portion of the economy.

			<h3>Autobaker</h3>
			This is an afk cookies generator that can be purchased from the
			shop. Use this command to view, upgrade, or collect from your
			autobaker using the corresponding arguments (same as the action).

			<h3>Crystalpress</h3>
			Purchased from the shop, use this command to view, upgrade, or use
			your crystal press, as long as you have at least 48 power. Upon use,
			the crystal press will attempt to convert one of your bags of sugar
			into a crystal at a chance that increases with each level up of the
			crystal press. This uses up one strength concentrate, and it is an
			efficient way to obtain crystals.

			<h3>Enchant</h3>
			Very similar to the crystal press, after purchasing this item from
			the shop you can call this command to use the enchantment table, as
			long as you have at least 64 power. The enchantment table will
			attempt to convert butter into enchanted butter at the cost of one
			magic essence, making it the most effective way to obtain this rare
			material.

			<h3>Forge</h3>
			After purchasing this item from the shop, you can use this command
			to view what upgrades you've purchased, see info and costs about
			upgrades, or buy upgrades using the view, ingo, and use arguments
			respectively. You need at least 32 power to use the forge. Upgrades
			from the forge permanently increase the usefulness and profitability
			of other commands in the economy, those being beg, search, mine, and
			timely commands. This provides an effective late-game way to bring
			old commands back into use even after they have ceased to be
			efficient.

			<h2 class="center-text">Helpful extra commands</h2>
			These commands show some kind of information about your economy
			profile, or something else important to the system.

			<h3>Donate</h3>
			Donate to support the bot's development through patreon. Donating
			will require you to have a patreon account linked to your discord
			one, and will give you access to various epic features in the
			economy and the bot in general. While not by any means necessary for
			progression, all donations are greatly appreciated, and will help
			both the developers and you out.

			<h3>Support</h3>
			Provides a link to the
			<a href="https://discord.com/invite/gCBJ5gW">support server</a>.
			Once there you can suggest features for the bot, get your questions
			answered, report issues you found with the bot, and chat with other
			members of the Pandicon community. You can also use the claim
			command there to receive a bonus hardened chocolate crate to start
			your journey through the economy on the right foot.

			<h2 class="center-text">Conclusion</h2>
			In conclusion, this guide only scratches the surface of the immense
			complexity and fun that there to be had in the Pandicon economy.
			While we hope that it's helpful, the best way to get into the
			economy is simply by trying it out for yourself. Thank you for
			reading, and we hope that you have a great time grinding the
			Pandicon economy system!
